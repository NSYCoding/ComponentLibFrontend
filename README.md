# ComponentLibFrontend

## Introduction
I am going to make a component library using Web Components. These components will be my go-to solution when I want to make full-stack applications. The result is supposed to allow me to focus on the backend of the code with less design and more code. I needed this repo to be beginner-friendly for those just starting out. So, I used Web Components. I hope you will find this repo of any use and I wish you having allot of fun coding.
